        <h1> Eva Zhuo</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Eva and I am a student at Emerald High School. My personal career goals are to be successful and be financially stable. Right now, I am not sure what I want to study in the future. I am currently trying to discover what I have a passion for that would work as a possible job. Some fields I am interested in are computer science, business, and economics. I chose these fields because I have always been very interested in computers and starting a business. I know that whatever career I choose will require hard work, dedication, and motivation, but I am confident I will succeed. Even though I am still unsure about my exact career path, my plan is to explore different classes and opportunities that will help me figure out what I actually enjoy. 

Some of my skills are creativity, problem solving, and working well under pressure. During group projects, I demonstrate creativity by coming up with ideas and problem solving solutions that come up with the project. Some characteristics I have that relate to some of the fields I want to pursue are being artistic, persistent, and dependable. To start a business, you need to be persistent and keep trying because a large amount of businesses go bankrupt in the first year. You need to be artistic and dependable if you have a career in computer science in order to solve problems about a program with your colleagues and brainstorm ways of fixing them. 

Some of my major achievements I have accomplished in high school are getting on to the cheer team and taking two courses over the summer. I do not have many so far but I hope to expand my list of accomplishments. Through joining cheer, I have learned a lot about teamwork, commitment, and discipline. I have gotten better at working with others from showing up at practice on time and learned to trust and rely on my teammates during stunts. Before cheer, I never did any sport so it took a lot of commitment and discipline to practice at home, work out, and show up to every practice. By taking two courses over the summer, I have proven how committed and dedicated I can be. Through taking those courses, I have learned essential time management skills and how to teach concepts to myself. 

In conclusion, while I still do not know what career path I plan to take, I am trying to discover my passion by exploring different classes and opportunities. I am great at working well, problem solving, and coming up with creative ideas which will benefit my future career. Through high school, I have learned a lot through taking courses over the summer and getting on to the cheer team. I hope to expand my knowledge and achievements in the future.
